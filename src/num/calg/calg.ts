 * '+' and '-' are either unary prefix or binary infix operators
 * '*', '/', and '^' are binary infix operators
 * '!' is a unary postfix operator

 *
 * ==== PRECEDENCE HIERARCHY ==============
 * | level 1 | function names  | <-- highest
 * | level 2 | !               |
 * | level 3 | ^               |
 * | level 4 | * /             |
 * | level 5 | + -             | <-- lowest
 *
 * == General Rule ==
 * For operators at the same level, the operator
 * to the right has lower lower precedence (this is
 * called right associativity).
 *
 * == Exception ==
 * For the '^' operator, the operator to the left
 * has lower precedence.
 *
 * == Parens ==
 * If two operators are at different parentheses levels,
 * the operator outside the pair of parentheses has lower
 * precendence than the operator inside the parentheses.
